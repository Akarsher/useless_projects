### Project Description
The Mocking Calculator is a fun, interactive calculator that not only performs basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, but also teases and taunts the user with sarcastic or witty responses after each calculation. Every operation triggers a unique, humorous response, making simple math feel like a playful conversation

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
A normal calculator is useful but boring. It just shows the answer without any personality, making simple tasks feel repetitive and dull. There‚Äôs no fun or feedback‚Äîjust plain results. 

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We gave a human behavior to the calculator which makes it more fun and user friendly.
